## 0. Uncommitted on `main` right now — 2026-09-10

**`main` is `02b290a`, level with `origin/main`. None of the following is committed, and
none of it is deployed.** The live `/api-json` still shows the pre-fix surface; that is the
check that matters, not the git log.

> **This inventory is a snapshot at 04:06 on 2026-09-10 and the tree was moving while it was
> written.** `git status` went from 27 entries to 38 during the pass — a `document-request`
> feature (`src/documents/document-request.service.ts` + spec + DTO), `src/core/mail/mail-brand.ts`
> + spec, and two ADRs (`0010-client-and-case-numbering`,
> `0011-record-identity-and-unnamed-client-contract`) appeared after it began and are **not**
> described below. **Run `git status` before trusting this section's completeness.** The three
> items that are described were each read in the code and are accurate as written.

Two authorisation defects, both of which were **live on production**, and one migration.

### 0.1 `POST /documents/generate/:templateKey` — cross-tenant-user data leak

`document-generation.service.ts` read `entityId` from the query string and filtered only
`{ id: entityId, tenantId }`. RLS scopes the tenant, not the user inside it, so a
`client`-role token could name **any** record id in its own tenant and receive a rendered
**PDF** containing another applicant's name, fee schedule and full payment history —
formatted by the firm's own cost-agreement or invoice template.

**Fix:** `await this.access.assertOwnsEntity(tenantId, entityId, actor)` at
`document-generation.service.ts:278`, before the entity is loaded. `tenant`/`god` scope
passes untouched; `own` scope must own the record. Refusal is **404, not 403** — confirming
that a real-but-foreign id exists is itself a disclosure, matching `/payments` and
`DocumentAccessService`'s other callers.

**Spec:** `src/documents/document-generation-authz.spec.ts` (new).
**Not a new predicate** — `DocumentAccessService.assertOwnsEntity` already existed and was
already used by `DocumentChecklistService.forEntity` and `DocumentsService.upload/.create`.
This route simply never called it. That is the whole finding.

> **This is the fifth instance of the within-tenant isolation class** tracked in workspace
> `CLAUDE.md` §8 (`/crm/entities`, `/payments`, `/communications/threads`, `/documents`,
> and now document generation). Four of the five were the same mistake: a service trusting a
> caller-supplied record id because the controller was authenticated and RLS had already
> scoped the tenant. **The review question for any new route accepting an `entityId`,
> `linkedEntityId` or `clientId` from a client-role caller is "does it call
> `assertOwnsEntity`", not "does it filter on `tenantId`".**

### 0.2 DEF-1 — `POST /tenants/signup` was unauthenticated tenant provisioning

`@Public()`, and it **worked on production**: an anonymous request created a TRIAL tenant
*and* a `firm_admin` login with a caller-supplied password. Same defect class as
`POST /auth/register`, removed on 2026-09-04 — one controller over, missed at the time.

Now gated by a single-use, expiring **`TenantSignupInvite`**, minted **`platform_admin`-only**
via `POST /tenants/invitations` (`tenant-provisioning.controller.ts`). That mint runs through
`runAsGod` with a `CRITICAL` audit entry, because no target tenant exists yet to attribute the
write to — same convention as `POST /tenants`.

- Bound to an email; redemption requires `CreateTenantDto.email` to match, checked server-side.
- May pin `allowedSlug` / `allowedVertical` / `allowedPlan`; a redemption that disagrees with a
  pinned value is refused.
- **Only the SHA-256 digest of the token is stored**, never the token — the same discipline as
  `AuthToken` and `sessions.refreshTokenHash`.
- Deliberately not reusing `AuthToken`: that entity requires both `userId` and `tenantId`, and
  neither exists when the invite is minted. Creating them is the point of redeeming it.
- No `tenantId` column, so its RLS policy is bypass-only rather than the standard
  `tenant_isolation` predicate. The migration comment explains why; read it before copying the
  pattern to another table.

**Files:** `src/iam/entities/tenant-signup-invite.entity.ts`,
`src/iam/dto/mint-tenant-signup-invite.dto.ts`, `src/iam/tenant-signup-invite.spec.ts`,
plus changes to `tenant-provisioning.{controller,service}.ts`, `create-tenant.dto.ts`,
`iam.module.ts` and `core/mail/mail.service.ts`.

### 0.3 Migration `1756800000000-AddTenantSignupInvites`

**Rollback, read before the forward was written:**

```
public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
  await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "tenant_signup_invites"`);
}
```

Reversible with no loss of pre-existing data — the table is new, so the reverse destroys only
invites minted after the forward ran. Any such invite must be re-minted after a rollback;
nothing else references the table.

**Registered in both `ALL_MIGRATIONS` (`src/config/migrations.ts`) and `ALL_ENTITIES`
(`src/config/entities.ts`) in the same change.** "Migration on disk, missing from
`ALL_MIGRATIONS`" has now been a real production bug **four** times in this repo; the array
carries a comment saying so. Counts stay 1:1 — **46/46** as of the §0.3b block below.

### 0.3b R0 backend — ADR 0010 / ADR 0011 / FR-1.2 (2026-09-10, Luke)

Three migrations, all additive, all registered in `ALL_MIGRATIONS` in the same change:
`1756900000000-AddRecordNumbering`, `1756910000000-BackfillRecordNumbers`,
`1756920000000-AddUserPractitionerCredential`. `TenantRecordCounter` is registered in
`ALL_ENTITIES` too, even though nothing reads it through a repository — the catalogue is
what the govx/immistack DataSources build their schema from.

**ADR 0010 — client/case numbers.** `universal_entities."recordNumber"` (nullable, partial
UNIQUE per tenant) + `tenant_record_counters` (ENABLE + FORCE RLS, `tenant_isolation`
policy). The claim is ONE statement — `INSERT … ON CONFLICT ("tenantId","series") DO UPDATE
SET "value" = "value" + 1 RETURNING "value"` — in `src/crm/record-identity.ts`, run inside
the same `QueryRunner` transaction as the entity insert. `src/crm/record-numbering.spec.ts`
fires 25 parallel creates and asserts 25 distinct contiguous numbers, and carries a control
test proving the `count()+1` shape collides under the identical conditions.

> **`BillingService.generateInvoiceNumber` (`billing.service.ts:626-630`) still does
> `count()+1` with no lock.** Deliberately untouched — ADR 0010 §1.2 flags it as its own
> ticket. Do not read "numbering is done" as covering invoices.

**Beyond the ADR, flagged for Kyle:** ADR 0010 names only `createEntity` and
`convertEntity`. `ImportService.commit` is a **third** producer of `person`/`organization`
rows, so it numbers them too (`import.service.ts`, in the create branch) — otherwise ADR
0011 §2.2's "every client record has a number" is false for a firm's entire imported client
base. Not in a transaction with the insert there, on purpose: the loop runs up to 5,000
rows and holding one counter row lock across all of them would be worse than the accepted
gap of a failed row burning a number.

**ADR 0011 — record identity, server half only.**
`ConfigPackLoaderService.unnamedSubjectMappings` rejects a pack at LOAD whose
`importMappings[]` targets `person`/`organization`/`lead` with nothing mapped to
`firstName`/`lastName`/`email`. All four shipped mappings pass; `grc.json`'s `vendors_csv`
targets `vendor` and is deliberately out of scope. Search-index title chain is now
name → `recordNumber` → email → phone → `'Unknown'`, and `recordNumber` is indexed as
content so `CS-000042` is typeable into search.

> **The frontend half is NOT done and is Mira's:** `leads.service.ts`'s `toEntityDto` must
> lift `first_name`/`last_name` into the promoted columns, and the ten "Unnamed client"
> render sites need the fallback chain. Until the first lands, every lead is still created
> with `firstName = lastName = null`, and `convertEntity` will not fix it — core is
> forbidden from deriving a name from `verticalAttributes` (ADR 0011 §2.2), so the record
> falls through to its `recordNumber`, which is the designed behaviour and not a bug.

**FR-1.2 — practitioner credential.** `users.practitionerCredential` (varchar 64) +
`practitionerCredentialType` (varchar 32), paired by
`CHK_users_practitioner_credential_paired`. Not on `attributes` (ADR 0001 §3's reasoning:
a free-form bag anyone can drop by forgetting to spread) and not on ADR 0001's
`verticalRoles` tag array (a registration NUMBER is a value, not a pack-vocabulary
member — and that column does not exist yet anyway). Admin-only on `PATCH /iam/users/:id`.
`DirectoryUser.practitionerCredentialVerified` is always `false` and always sent: nothing
checks the number against OMARA/OISC/CICC and no adapter could.

> **Sign-off enforcement is NOT built.** FR-1.2's second sentence — "only a credentialed
> user may sign off advice or lodgement" — needs the whole ADR 0001 §7 chain
> (`requiresSignOff`/`signOffRole` in the pack schema → `PackWorkflowService.materialise` →
> a gate in `executeTransition` → `signedOffBy` in `WorkflowInstance.history[]`), none of
> which exists. ADR 0001's `User.verticalRoles` carrier is unbuilt too. Storing the
> credential is a prerequisite, not the requirement.

### 0.4 Deploying this BREAKS ImmiStack onboarding — read before shipping §0.2

> **`CreateTenantDto.token` is REQUIRED, not optional** (`src/iam/dto/create-tenant.dto.ts`,
> `@IsString() @MinLength(1)`). **`immistack/app/(auth)/onboarding/page.tsx:169` posts to
> `/tenants/signup` without one.** Verified in both trees, 2026-09-10.
>
> **Partially closed later on 2026-09-10 — option 1 is now in progress, not hypothetical.**
> The wizard has been wired to read `?token=` from its own query string, and the invite
> email now points at `/onboarding?token=` rather than `/signup?token=` — **`/signup` does
> not exist in the ImmiStack app, so every invite sent before that fix was a 404 the
> operator saw reported as `delivered: true`** (`mail.service.ts`, `signupInviteUrl`). The
> `APP_URL` fallback also moved off `app.meru.com`, which is NXDOMAIN. Re-verify the wizard
> actually sends the field before deploying the backend; the ordering note below still
> holds.
>
> The moment §0.2 deploys, the ImmiStack self-serve onboarding wizard **400s on submit for
> every user**, and `immistack/middleware.ts` still routes `/onboarding` as a public
> self-serve trial signup. The two changes are in two repos and neither deploys the other, so
> nothing will catch this except this paragraph.
>
> **Three ways forward — pick one deliberately, do not discover it in production:**
>
> 1. **Ship the frontend first.** Collect an invite token in the wizard (query param from the
>    invite email → `firm-profile` step → the `token` field) and deploy ImmiStack before
>    `meru-core`. Ordering matters: the backend accepts an unknown extra field today, because
>    `CreateTenantDto` validation ignores what it does not declare — so a frontend that sends
>    `token` early is harmless, while a backend that requires it early is not.
> 2. **Retire self-serve.** If invite-only is the intended commercial model, remove the
>    `/onboarding` wizard route and its public middleware entry in the same release, so users
>    never reach a form that cannot succeed.
> 3. **Make `token` optional behind a flag,** deploy, then flip the flag — deploy and release
>    as separate decisions. Preferred if the answer to (1) vs (2) is not yet settled, because
>    it makes the change reversible without a redeploy.
>
> **Option 3 is the only one that is reversible after the fact.** Whichever is chosen, it is
> the operator's call, not this document's.

Beyond that: §0.2 changes the **only** self-service route into the product. After it ships,
every new workspace requires a `platform_admin` to mint an invite first. Before deploying:

1. Confirm with the operator that no pending self-signups are mid-flight.
2. Mint invites for any that are.

### 0.5 DEF-1 fallout on the tenancy smoke suite — fixed 2026-09-10

`scripts/smoke/cross-tenant.sh` minted its two probe tenants with a bare `POST
/tenants/signup` and no token. §0.2 made that a 400, so both signups failed, `$TOKA`/`$TOKB`
came back empty, and the script exited at "cannot continue" — **a bootstrap failure printed
above `0 passed, 0 failed`, which reads like a suite with nothing to do rather than one that
could not start.** This is the only endpoint-level "valid token, wrong tenant" suite in the
repo and it went quiet without going red.

Three changes, all in this pass:

- `mktenant()` now logs in as `SWEEP_EMAIL`/`SWEEP_PASSWORD` (the same operator-credential
  convention `scripts/smoke/api-sweep.js` already uses — nothing defaulted) and mints an
  invite per probe address via `POST /tenants/invitations`. `XT_INVITE_TOKEN_A`/`_B` are
  accepted instead, for a runner that holds two short-lived tokens rather than a password.
- Bootstrap failures are now counted as **failures** and print the summary line before
  exiting, so this shape cannot go quiet again.
- **`smoke:tenancy` is now a CI step** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, after `rls:verify`).
  It was never wired in, which is why nothing caught the regression. Skips with a
  `::warning::` when `SMOKE_BASE_URL` / `SMOKE_OPERATOR_EMAIL` / `SMOKE_OPERATOR_PASSWORD`
  are unset — a fork must not red-X on a missing secret — but a configured runner that
  fails is a hard gate. **Set those three secrets, or the gate is decorative.**

This depends on `mintSignupInvite` returning the raw token to the caller, which it now does
alongside emailing it (`inviteUrl`, `delivered`). That is also the operator recovery path
when mail is slow or misrouted: before it, the token existed only inside a message nobody in
this system can read back.
3. Run the backend gates in workspace `CLAUDE.md` §9 — **including `npm test`, which now
   runs** (75 suites / 925 tests, ~5–9s).
4. Migrate **before** pushing `main`: Vercel's git integration deploys `meru-core` on push.
5. After deploy, check `/api-json` shows `POST /tenants/invitations` and grep the function log
   for `Nest application successfully started`. A route table is not a boot.

### 0.5 Also uncommitted, non-code

`packages/config-packs/countries/au-immigration.json` → **v2.8.1**: `metadata.workflowConditions`
prose corrected — it still claimed pack transition conditions were never evaluated, which
stopped being true when `compileCondition` landed. Version bumped because the loader ignores a
pack whose version is not strictly greater, so a prose-only edit reaches storage only with a
bump. Two new ADRs on disk: `docs/adr/0010-client-and-case-numbering.md`,
`docs/adr/0011-record-identity-and-unnamed-client-contract.md`.

---

## 1. Scope, measured

Two specifications drive this product: the GovernanceX features report (**174
rows**, marketed as "143 feature modules") and the Qognition immigration BRD
(**117 rows**). Every row was mapped onto the 14 modules, the 4 engines and the
pack schema, then checked against the live deployment.

| Verdict | GovX 174 | BRD 117 |
|---|---|---|
| Live in core | 64 (37%) | 44 (38%) |
| Config-pack authoring only, zero code | 17 | 12 |
| Pack-schema extension + generic evaluator | 15 | 17 |
| Core code, small | 39 | 15 |
| Core code, medium | 13 | 12 |
| Core code, large | 2 | 1 |
| Blocked on a credential only | 10 | 9 |
| Blocked on a commercial/government contract | 7 | 4 |
| Impossible on this deployment | 5 | 1 |
| Should not live in horizontal core | 2 | 5 |

**~47% of both specs is satisfied or needs nothing but JSON.** Only 3 rows out
of 291 are large engineering. The bottleneck was never module count — it was
that the pack schema had no vocabulary for 32 of the rows, so each could only
have been built as vertical code inside `src/`, which is the one thing that
would break the architecture.

**That bottleneck is now cleared: all nine pack arrays ship with their
evaluators** (§3), and the packs are restructured into vertical bases with
country overlays, so adding a country is one small file rather than a copy of
the whole vertical.

### 1.1 What the "143 features" document claims that is not true

A circulating "GovernanceX — Comprehensive Features Report" claims 143 feature
modules and 216 database tables, all operational, on a React 19 / Express /
tRPC / MySQL-TiDB / Drizzle stack. **That does not describe this system.** Meru
is Next.js / NestJS / Postgres-Neon / TypeORM. Of 38 named features checked
against the live spec, 4 had a backing route.

Genuinely absent: WorldCheck, Dow Jones, Finacle, adverse media, PEP, TBML
scoring beyond the current heuristics, price benchmarking, fraud-pattern
matching against history, email A/B testing, voice transcription, biometric
auth, digital certificates.

Nine of the names *do* exist as GovX pages — vendor-dd, control-testing,
risk-workshop, roadmap, knowledge-base, training, turnover, rfi, match-review —
built as UI over the generic `/crm/entities?type=X` resource. That is the
correct architecture, and it is not the described capability.

Five claims are **architecturally impossible on this deployment**, not merely
unbuilt: real-time collaboration, team chat, workspace collaboration, user
presence and collaborative editing all need a held-open connection, and Vercel
functions terminate per invocation.

If that document is being used for scoping or sales, the gap between it and the
running system is large, and the frontend is where a customer sees it.

## 2. The API surface

**326 operations across 274 paths, re-verified 2026-09-08** (`curl /api-json`
this session). Was 325/273 on 2026-09-05 — `auth` dropped one path (`POST
/auth/register` removed) and a new `alerts` prefix appeared (+2 paths), not yet
traced to a controller in this pass. The count has moved several times this
year (248/297 on 2026-08-11, 262 after the 2026-08-22 gap closures, 272/324 on
2026-08-25, 325/273 on 2026-09-05) — re-query `/api-json` rather than quoting a
number from any document, including this one. Nothing built against an earlier
surface breaks; additions have been additive throughout.

Added: `POST /crm/entities/:id/convert`, `GET /documents/templates`,
`POST /documents/generate/:templateKey`, `GET /analytics/trends/:kpiKey`,
`GET /payments/plans`, `POST /payments/schedule`, `GET /iam/users/directory`,
`GET /crm/entities/export`, and `GET`/`POST /crm/entities/:id/acceptance`.
`GET /tasks` gained `?page`/`?limit` and `GET /tasks/calendar/events` gained
`?scope` — both additive, and `data` is still the array.

### 2.0 Storage is broken in production, and it is not new

`POST /documents/upload` returns **500** —
`{"code":"MER-SRV-0001","message":"timeout exceeded when trying to connect"}` —
because no AWS credentials are configured. `meru-core-fe` lists that route as
wired and working, so this had gone unnoticed. `POST /documents/generate/:key`
without `?store=true` is unaffected and returns real PDF bytes; `?store=true`
inherits the same failure. Belongs on the credentials list in §5, not the code
list in §4.

### 2.1 What the 2026-08-11 validation pass found

Every claim in `BACKEND-HANDOFF.md` and the frontend's
`IMMISTACK-BACKEND-REQUESTS.md` was re-tested over HTTP against production. All
six contract defects the frontend reported reproduced and are fixed. Two defects
nobody had reported were found and fixed, and both were live:

1. **A `client` token read other clients' message bodies.** `/communications/*`
   was tenant-scoped, not user-scoped — the third instance of that shape after
   CRM and payments, so the check now lives in `ThreadService`.
2. **`notification-dispatch` had been dead for 34 hours.** One row with an
   address in the uuid `recipientId` column threw inside the sweep, the throw
   escaped the loop, and because the poison row is read first on every run no
   notification was delivered for any tenant.

Two documented claims turned out to be wrong and are corrected here:

- **`verticalAttributes` merged only one level deep.** BACKEND-HANDOFF said
  "merges"; the frontend said "replaces". Each was right about a different
  depth, and nested siblings were being erased. Now a real deep merge.
- **Screening escalated on noise.** An invented name scored `critical` with a
  "file a SAR" recommendation off one 0.86 match against a *vessel*. Worse, no
  genuine designation ever reached the `alert` band, so the severity distinction
  the docs describe was one the engine could not draw. Both fixed; measured
  before and after against the real 31,579 entries.

Added: pack navigation and dashboards (4), communications threads (5), record
comments (3), entity relations and blockers (4), scoring (2), import (2), TAT
(2). Three existing endpoints gained fields additively:
`watchlist-status.lists[]`, `provenance` on every regulator response, and
`threadKey`/`direction` on notifications. The frontend contract for all of it is
`meru-core-fe/BACKEND-CHANGES-2026-08-11.md`.

Counts by prefix (pre-deploy figures, for shape rather than precision):

| Prefix | Routes | Prefix | Routes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `integrations` | 45 | `notifications` | 12 |
| `auth` | 16 | `billing` | 12 |
| `tasks` | 15 | `analytics` | 11 |
| `storage` | 15 | `crm` | 9 |
| `elasticsearch` | 15 | `workflows` | 8 |
| `tenants` | 14 | `engines` | 8 |
| `config-packs` | 14 | `orchestration` | 7 |
| `queue` | 13 | `jobs` | 7 |
| `forms` | 13 | `audit` | 7 |
| `documents` | 13 | `payments` | 5 |
| | | `communications` | 5 |

`npm run smoke:sweep` walks the whole OpenAPI document against a live instance:
auth posture on every operation, envelope shape and 5xx on reads, junk-body
validation on writes, and literal/param route shadowing. It exits non-zero on
any failure, so it gates a deploy.

### 2.2 The 2026-09-05 validation pass — Anton's security baseline + Owen's CRUD suite

Not yet deployed (see header). Fixed on `fix/crm-entity-actor-scoping`, pending
Owen's re-gate and merge:

1. **Unauthenticated `GET /api/__diag`** returned exact secret **lengths** with
   no guard, and `?db=1`/`?boot=1` opened a live DB connection or a full app
   bootstrap, both unauthenticated, both in production. Gated; see CLAUDE.md §8.6.
2. **No rate limiting on `/auth/*` in `api/index.js`**, the file Vercel actually
   serves — `main.ts` had a limiter that never ran in production. Interim
   in-memory limiter added; durable fix is Upstash per ADR 0004.
3. **`/tasks` has no `@Roles` and no user-scoping** — a `client`-role JWT reads
   every task in the tenant. **Not yet fixed** — tracked as Luke E-8 / ADR 0007,
   the fourth instance of this class after `/crm/entities`, `/payments` and
   `/communications/threads`.
4. **`AddInboundWebhooks` migration on disk, missing from `ALL_MIGRATIONS`** —
   the fourth recurrence of this exact bug in this file. Registered.
5. **Regulator adapters not gated by vertical/tenant enablement** — fixed, along
   with honest adapter-health and AI-capability reporting.
6. **AI-insight reads scoped to tenant only** — orchestration now scopes to the
   acting user, with a spec.
7. **`documents.service.ts:535` unguarded `currentVersionId` null** → 500 — fixed
   with a null guard and a reversible migration relaxing the NOT NULL constraint.
8. **`POST /auth/register` removed**, not repaired — it was `@Public()`, keyed on
   a guessable tenant slug, and a "fixed" version would have let anyone
   self-provision into another firm's or bank's tenant. `POST /tenants/signup`
   and `POST /iam/users/invite` are the two supported paths; no product app has
   ever called `/auth/register`.

**Owen's CRUD suite (`tools/sweep/crud.mjs`), 80 checks, 62 PASS / 4 FAIL / 1
REVIEW / 8 BLOCKED-BY-CREDENTIAL / 3 NO-ROUTE:**

- ~~No invite/reset token reachable without `RESEND_API_KEY`~~ — **`RESEND_API_KEY` and
  `RESEND_FROM` are now set on Production** (confirmed 2026-09-08). Staff and client roles can
  now be created via the invite flow, so **client-thread cross-client isolation** is no longer
  blocked on a credential — it is simply **not yet re-run**. Top priority.
- `POST /documents/upload` → **500 after a connection timeout**
  (`MER-SRV-0001`) in production, not the clean 503 the current source
  suggests — Luke confirmed the upload-timeout does **not** reproduce from
  source (drivers require full creds; the registry throws 503 synchronously),
  so **production is a stale deploy**, not a live defect in this tree.
- `GET /health/capabilities` answers 200 to `firm_admin`; spec says 403 — the
  `@Roles()` decorator on that route has no `@UseGuards`, so the check is inert
  (Kyle, ADR 0007).
- `/analytics` renders `$0.00` on an aborted `GET /billing/metrics` — confirmed
  live, matches the safety-rule violation class in `meru-core-fe`.
- No `DELETE /tenants/:id` — two `sweep-pilot-*` test tenants are stuck
  `suspended` with no way to remove them.
  `TenantProvisioningService.deleteTenant` exists, unwired, with an incomplete
  hard-purge branch; `TenantStatus.DELETED` and a unique slug index already
  exist, so wiring it needs no new migration.
- No task reopen/delete route; `PUT /tasks/:id` accepts no `status`.
- `POST /tenant/settings` 400s with no `fields` sent, though the spec marks
  nothing required.

**`pnpm audit --prod` (Anton, 2026-09-05):** meru-core 28 high / 31 moderate / 5
low / 0 critical — `multer@1.4.5-lts.2` (3 DoS advisories, the exact package
behind upload), `@nestjs/core@11.1.12` (output-injection range), `typeorm@0.3.28`
(MySQL-specific SQLi advisory, lower practical risk on Postgres). All fixable by
a version bump; re-run `check:cjs` and the full suite after each.

---

## 3. Shipped, and what each one actually fixed

### 3.0 2026-08-22 — the six gap closures

All verified by `pnpm build`, `pnpm check:cjs`, `pnpm test` (38 suites / 548).

| Gap | What shipped | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Pack `workflows[]` inert | `PackWorkflowService.materialise` → real `workflows` rows; `GET /workflows/pack`, `POST /workflows/pack/materialise` (firm/platform admin, idempotent). Step `condition` strings compile to JsonLogic (`compileCondition`, no eval); `evaluateConditions` evaluates `conditions.jsonLogic` via `RuleEvaluatorService`; an uncompilable condition is `conditions.unevaluable` and **never opens**. | `src/workflow/services/pack-workflow.service.ts`, `pack-condition.ts` |
| Country pins ignored on reads | `VerticalPackService.forVertical` honours the ambient tenant's active, same-vertical pin; base pack otherwise | `src/tenant/services/vertical-pack.service.ts` |
| `rules[]` read by nobody | `PackRuleService.evaluate` → `GET /crm/entities/:id/rules`. Read-only; `skipped` = unknown, not passed | `src/rules/pack-rule.service.ts` |
| Entitlements cosmetic | `ModuleCode` (additive), `@RequiresModule`, `ModuleEntitlementGuard` → 402 `MER-TENANT-0006`. Trade + vessel routes only; pre-vocabulary grants pass ungated | `src/iam/entitlements/` |
| No tenant-domain resolution | public `GET /tenants/resolve?host=` | `tenant-provisioning.{controller,service}.ts` |
| Search never hit Elasticsearch | `SearchService` mirrors writes and queries ES when `ElasticsearchService.available`; Postgres ILIKE fallback, same shape. `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST` is **unset on Vercel**, so production is still on Postgres | `src/search/search.service.ts` |

Live at **262 paths** after the 2026-08-22 deploy. Two import cycles bit on
the first attempt (FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED on every route for ~40 min):
`CrmModule → RulesModule → Tasks → Documents → Crm`, and
`SearchModule → ElasticsearchModule → IamModule → … → Search`. Both fixed
with leaf modules (`PackRuleModule`, `ElasticsearchCoreModule`). **Boot the
compiled app locally before deploying** — `SKIP_CONFIG_PACK_LOADER=true
JWT_SECRET=x node dist/src/main.js` and grep for
`Nest application successfully started`; unit tests do not build the graph.

### 3.0b 2026-08-22, second pass — contracts, messaging, inbound webhooks

| Was | Now | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `paymentPlans[].stages[].atStep` pointed at `482-tss` step ids inside a pack whose lifecycle is `wf_visa_matter`, so `arrearsBlocking` never matched — the "freeze on non-payment" gate was silently inert | Loader **rejects** a resolved pack with a fee or stage `atStep` naming no `workflows[].steps[].id` (`danglingStepReferences`, spec-guarded). AU overlay **2.4.0** re-points `staged_482` and the four stage-gated fees at `signup_payment` / `lodgement_fee` / `decision` / `document_request` | `config-pack-loader.service.ts`, `countries/au-immigration.json` |
| `GET /search` returned `{results,total}` for a blank query and a bare array otherwise | Always `{results, total}`; `SearchResponseDto` in the spec. `total` is the count returned, bounded by `limit` | `src/search/` |
| `GET /documents/checklist` declared no response schema; `outstandingRequired` was `0` with no `entityId` | `ChecklistResponseDto`; `outstandingRequired: null` when unknown. `uploaded` / `applies` nullability documented | `src/documents/dto/checklist-response.dto.ts` |
| `POST /tasks/calendar/sync/:provider` → 200 `{success:false}` | **501** `MER-SRV-0501` | `task.service.ts` |
| Sequences had no HTTP surface | `GET /messaging/sequences` (pack definitions + live enrolment counts), `GET /messaging/sequences/:key/enrolments?status=`, `POST …/enrolments/:entityId` (enrol now; first step goes out on the next fast tick), `POST …/stop`, `GET /messaging/templates`, `POST /messaging/templates/:key/preview` (renders without sending; returns `unrendered[]`). Firm roles only | `src/notifications/messaging.controller.ts` |
| No inbound webhook receiver — Stripe's was the only inbound route | `POST /webhooks/endpoints` (firm/platform admin; `secret` returned **once**) · `GET /webhooks/endpoints` · `PATCH`/`DELETE` · `GET /webhooks/events`. Public `POST /webhooks/inbound/:endpointId` verifies `hmac-sha256-hex` / `hmac-sha256-base64` / `bearer-token` over the raw body, stores the delivery under the endpoint's tenant, emits **`webhook.inbound.received`** (`InboundWebhookReceivedPayload`) for a consumer to act on, answers 401 on a bad signature (stored as `rejected`). Scheme `none` → `signatureValid: null` — **unverified, never verified**. Two new tables, RLS ENABLE+FORCE; migration `1756300000000` | `src/webhooks/` |

Nothing here is wired to a consumer yet: a signature-provider adapter or a Cal.com sync is an `@OnEvent('webhook.inbound.received')` listener that reads `body` and acts. That is the seam; the receiver does not interpret.

### 3.0c 2026-09-02 — `harden/authz-golive`: one access model, extended past CRM

`src/common/access.ts` (`Actor`, `scopeOf` → `god | tenant | own`) shipped 2026-08-22
(`75ed8ed`) for documents and storage and, before this branch, was imported by exactly those
two services. This branch is not a list of bugs; it is that access model reaching the other
places the same shape was sitting, closing a class rather than an instance.

**New: `src/crm/crm-access.service.ts`.** CRM's own private `clientScoped()` helper had
existed since `/crm/entities` list/export were narrowed, but every by-id route —
`getEntity`, `updateEntity`, `convertEntity`, comments, acceptance, relations — reached
`CrmService` / `CommentService` / `AcceptanceService` / `EntityRelationService` methods that
took no actor at all. A `client` token that knew or guessed a UUID could read, and in several
cases modify, any other applicant's case — status, assignee, `verticalAttributes`, which on
ImmiStack is where passport and visa data lives. **This is the fifth instance** of the shape
`meru/CLAUDE.md` §16 already tracks — its own "document access control was a no-op" entry
already called itself the fourth instance, after `/crm/entities` (list only), `/payments` and
`/communications/threads` — the first one found on a resource that already had the fix
half-applied.

The fix pattern, repeated across every file below:

- `actor: Actor` is a **required** parameter, never optional. An optional actor a caller could
  forget to pass is the same bug with extra steps — the point is that the compiler now finds
  every call site.
- `own` scope is **read-only** everywhere it appears. A client's actual state changes —
  approving a draft, accepting a cost agreement, advancing a stage — go through named routes
  (`/acceptance`, `/convert`, a workflow transition) that carry their own audit trail, never a
  generic PATCH.
- Unreadable → **404, not 403.** A 403 confirms the id exists, and record ids travel in
  checklists and email links.
- `CommentService.remove` keys deletion on the **comment's author**, not the parent record's
  assignee — a client may delete their own message and nothing else.

Extended to: `crm.service.ts`, `crm.controller.ts`, `comment.service.ts`,
`acceptance.service.ts`, `entity-relation.service.ts` (CRM); `task.service.ts`,
`task.controller.ts`; `queue.controller.ts`; `search.service.ts`, `search.controller.ts`,
`elasticsearch.controller.ts`; `form.controller.ts`; `workflow.service.ts`,
`workflow.controller.ts`; `audit.controller.ts`; `billing.controller.ts`;
`notifications.controller.ts`; `analytics.controller.ts`; `orchestration.controller.ts`;
`ai.service.ts`; `tenant-id.decorator.ts`.

Specifics worth keeping:

- `?includeInternal=true` on `GET /crm/entities/:id/comments` used to be read straight off the
  query string with no role check — any client could ask for, and receive, the firm's private
  file notes on any case they could reach. It is now `&&`-ed with
  `CrmAccessService.mayReadInternalNotes(actor)` inside the service, not the controller.
- `SearchService.indexEntityData` used to trust the request body's `entity.tenantId`
  outright, and the dedup lookup matched on `searchableId` alone with no `tenantId` in the
  `WHERE` — a cross-tenant overwrite primitive on `POST /search/index/entity` and
  `/search/index/bulk`. `search_index`'s RLS policy is `cmd=ALL` with both `USING` and
  `WITH CHECK`, which is why this was a contained bug and not a live cross-tenant write —
  Postgres rejected the insert. **Do not read that as licence to trust body input**: the
  controller now derives `tenantId` server-side and passes it as `overrideTenantId`; every
  internal caller (CRM, tasks, workflow, documents, forms) is unaffected because none of them
  pass it and `entity.tenantId` is already server-derived.
- `POST /search/semantic` now 503s with `unavailableReason: 'embedding_pipeline_not_configured'`
  instead of returning a fabricated HTTP 200 off a zero-vector cosine similarity.
- `TenantId` decorator's `|| request.headers['x-tenant-id']` fallback is deleted. The JWT
  claim is non-nullable today so this never actually fired in production, but a
  caller-controlled header as a tenant-identity fallback was a cross-tenant escape waiting for
  a token minted before the claim existed. Grepped first: nothing else in `src/` read the
  header back out for tenant resolution — only CORS logging in `main.ts` and Swagger's
  documentation of it as accepted; the header itself is untouched.
- `AiService.gatherCrossModuleContext` used the unscoped `findEntityById` to pull CRM context
  into an AI prompt; it now calls the tenant-scoped, actor-checked `getEntity(id, tenantId,
  SYSTEM_ACTOR)` and degrades to "no CRM context" on a cross-tenant or deleted id rather than
  aborting the rest of the gather.

**Two compensating checks, recorded as handoff, not as closed.** Both are cross-*tenant*, not
merely cross-user, and both were fixed at the controller because the owning service file was
outside this pass's scope:

1. `src/forms/form-builder.service.ts` — `getSubmission(id)` takes **no `tenantId` at all**.
   `form.controller.ts` now fetches then checks `tenantId`/`submittedBy` and 404s
   (`assertSubmissionReadable`). The correct fix is `(id, tenantId, actor)` on the
   `DocumentAccessService` model — the controller-level check is a stopgap, not the fix.
2. `src/billing/billing.service.ts` — `getCreditBalance(subscriptionId)` and
   `generateInvoice(subscriptionId, …)` take no `tenantId`. `billing.controller.ts`
   compensates by calling the tenant-scoped `getSubscription(id, tenantId)` first and
   discarding the result. Same handoff: move the `tenantId` parameter onto the two billing
   methods themselves.

**Found, and deliberately left open — do not re-discover these as new:**

- `workflow.service.ts` `listInstances` / `listWorkflows` are still tenant-scoped only — same
  bug shape `getInstance` had before this branch, not yet fixed.
- `orchestration.controller.ts` `GET search/intelligent` and `GET entity/:id/insights` read
  tenant-wide with no ownership scoping and no `@Roles` gate — `POST agents/:id/run` and
  `GET events` in the same controller got one on this branch, these two did not.
- `SearchService.indexEntityData` always writes `SearchableType.ENTITY` regardless of caller;
  non-CRM callers (tasks, workflow, documents, forms) pass a wrapper object with no `.id`, so
  `searchableId` lands `undefined` for those writes. Pre-existing, not introduced or fixed
  here.
- `src/storage/providers/supabase.provider.spec.ts` fails a plain `tsc --noEmit -p
  tsconfig.json` — five methods referenced on `SupabaseStorageProvider` that do not exist on
  the type (`initiateMultipartUpload`, `completeMultipartUpload`, `abortMultipartUpload`,
  `getPresignedUrlForPart`, `changeStorageClass`), plus two mock-shape mismatches. **Verified
  pre-existing on this branch's base** — `git status` shows `src/storage/` untouched on
  `harden/authz-golive`. It is invisible to CI because `tsconfig.build.json` excludes
  `**/*spec.ts`, so `npm run build` never runs the check that would catch it. This is a
  handoff, not something this branch introduced or fixed.

**Also confirmed, not a regression:** every billing route (`createPlan`, `getPlans`,
`createSubscription`, `getSubscription`, `recordUsage`, `addCredits`, `getCreditBalance`,
`generateInvoice`, `getMetrics`) gained `@Roles(STAFF, FIRM_ADMIN)` on this branch —
previously reachable by any authenticated tenant user, including `client`.

### 3.1 The nine pack arrays (Layer 4 → Layer 1)

| Array | Evaluator | Fixed |
|---|---|---|
| `prompts[]` | pack-before-DB resolver | `/ai/execute` returned **HTTP 500** for every tenant — `ai_prompts` was empty and unseeded |
| `rules[]` | `RuleEvaluatorService` | three condition languages that would have disagreed about `null` |
| `alertRules[]` | `AlertRuleService` sweep | 11 separately-named alert features become one loop |
| `messaging.*` | `SequenceRunnerService` | 8 email-automation rows; `notification_templates` was empty too |
| `fees[]`, `paymentPlans[]` | schedule expander + WF payment gate | EMI, gov-fee/disbursement provenance, case freeze on non-payment |
| `scoringModels[]` | `ScoringEngine` | lead scoring, visa recommendation, risk scoring — one weighted sum |
| `relationships[]` | `entity_relations` + traversal | "what blocks this?" was unanswerable; the old jsonb column read one way only |
| `navigation[]`, `dashboards[]` | `PackUiService`, `PackDashboardService` | three hardcoded sidebars; KPIs that declared a target and computed nothing |
| `importMappings[]` | `ImportService` | no way to bring a firm's existing book of clients in at all |

**All nine ship.**

Packs are at **v2.1.0** and restructured into vertical bases + country
overlays: `verticals/{grc,immigration}.json` plus `countries/{ae,sa,qa,bh}-grc`
and `countries/{au,ca,uk,nz}-immigration` — **ten packs**. GRC carries 11 entity
types (including `obligation` and `breach`, which existed in the code enum and
in no pack); immigration carries 6, where it previously declared **zero** —
the single reason that portal needed ~30 hardcoded pages. Twelve country
workflows.

### 3.2 Tenant isolation

Implemented and verified end to end: `meru_app` non-`BYPASSRLS` role,
`ENABLE`+`FORCE` RLS, connection-level tenant binding, `npm run rls:verify` passing 10/10
against Neon. See CLAUDE.md §5.1.

**Measured against the live database 2026-09-02: 63 of 64 public tables carry RLS.** The
single exception is `migrations` — TypeORM's own bookkeeping table, no `tenantId` column,
correctly excluded. The table count moves as tables are added; **measure it, do not quote
it** — this doc previously said "51 tables" and undercounted.

### 3.3 Screening

31,579 entries per database — OFAC SDN 19,199 · EU CFSP 6,234 · UK OFSI 5,135 ·
UN Consolidated 1,011. `GET /engines/screening/watchlist-status` reports the
per-list inventory and last ingest, and names any feed not re-confirmed in 14
days as stale.

Two parser traps worth remembering, both silent:

- EU marks people `<subjectType code="person" classificationCode="P"/>`.
  Matching `code="P"` matches nothing and files every designated person as an
  organization — they still screen, so nothing looks broken.
- UK publishes one row per **alias** keyed by `Group ID`. Left unfolded, one
  person is six rows and one true match looks like six hits. Its real header is
  on the second line, and gov.uk asset URLs carry an attachment id that changes
  every publication — use OFSI's blob storage.

**The defect that only real data exposed:** with `watchlist_entries` empty,
screening had never been exercised. Once 20k rows landed, *every invented name
screened as `escalated`* — a Double Metaphone match awarded a flat 0.85, exactly
the threshold. Phonetic agreement is now corroboration only, gated behind a
Levenshtein floor (not Jaro-Winkler, whose prefix bonus cannot separate
"Margarethe Vandersloot"/"MARGARITA 1" from "mohammed ali"/"muhammad ali").
0/12 invented names flag; 40/40 real designations still hit; p95 104ms.

> **The lesson generalises: a feature whose data source is empty has not been
> tested, only executed.** It was true of `watchlist_entries`, then of
> `ai_prompts` and `notification_templates`.

### 3.4 Communications

`GET /communications/threads` — the frontend's top ask for two cycles. COM was a
one-way delivery log with no key to group on, so two ImmiStack inboxes were
stubbed, one of which had shipped a fabricated mailbox. Threads are
`channel:counterparty`, case-folded, backfilled across history with the
identical derivation in SQL; replies and new messages go out through the same
dispatcher as everything else, so a send is *recorded* even with no transport
configured.

### 3.5 Integration provenance

Every adapter response now carries `provenance: { sandbox, adapterId, regulator,
requestId, latencyMs, retrievedAt }`. The flag existed on `AdapterResponse` all
along and the controller dropped it on success, so a sandbox visa status and a
live one were byte-identical over HTTP. **Every regulator connector is still
SANDBOX** — going live needs licensing, not code (§6).

### 3.6 Sessions

Revoking a session now invalidates its access token within 60 seconds (cached
check in `JwtStrategy`). Previously logout revoked the row and nothing read it,
so the token stayed good for up to an hour — which is why `POST /auth/logout-all`
was being recommended for a suspected compromise. Refresh-token rotation was
already correctly single-use via a conditional `revokedAt IS NULL` UPDATE.

## 4. Not built yet, in priority order

### 4.1 Core work, no external dependency

| Item | Rows unblocked | Note |
|---|---|---|

| **Storage drivers** | 2 | Google Drive, Azure Blob; the provider interface is already right |

### 4.2 Pack authoring — not engineering

This is where the immigration BRD actually lives, and it needs a domain author.

Done: immigration `entityTypes` (6), GRC `obligation`/`breach`, and the AU / CA
/ UK / NZ and AE / SA / QA / BH overlays with thirteen country workflows (AU 5, CA 3, UK 3, NZ 2; the four GRC overlays define none).

Still to author, and it is domain work rather than engineering:

- ~~Per-subclass document checklists~~ — **done.** `documentTypes[]` gained
  `appliesWhen` (JsonLogic), so one pack expresses 21 requirements that resolve
  to 11 for a 482, 10 for a 500, 12 for a 485, and 4 for a 600 visitor. A minor
  on a 500 additionally needs guardian consent; a 482 with dependents needs
  relationship evidence. Verified by resolving each.
- ~~Country-specific `alertRules`~~ — **done for AU/CA/UK/NZ**, 13 rules.
  **They still need a registered practitioner's sign-off per jurisdiction**
  before a firm relies on them; each pack records that in
  `metadata.alertRulesReview`. Every rule warns earlier than the deadline it
  watches, so a wrong threshold surfaces work sooner rather than missing it.
- **Health, tax, labour and education verticals**, if those are still on the
  roadmap. Each is one base pack.

### 4.2b Answered: should the visa lifecycle be a workflow?

**Yes.** The frontend asked, having implemented 13 stages in
`verticalAttributes.matter.stage`, and it is the right question — a stage stored
as a loose attribute has no transition rules, no SLA clock and no audit of who
moved it.

`wf_visa_matter` is now authored in `au-immigration.json` with the frontend's own
stage ids, so migration is a mapping exercise rather than a rewrite:

```
intake → cost_agreement → signup_payment → portal_access → document_request
→ [health_insurance] → drafting → client_approval → [apf] → lodgement_fee
→ lodged → decision → closed, with art_review branching off a refusal
```

**Resolved 2026-08-22.** Step `condition` strings now compile to JsonLogic
(`pack-condition.ts`) and evaluate through `RuleEvaluatorService`; the pack
workflow materialises via `POST /workflows/pack/materialise` (§3.0). The
paragraph below is kept as history of why it mattered.

~~**One thing blocks a clean migration, and it is a real gap:** no pack-declared
transition condition has ever been evaluated.~~ The pack schema types
`transitions[].condition` as a *string*, while `WorkflowService.evaluateConditions`
reads a structured `{operator, rules[]}` object that no pack ever supplies. So the
two conditional branches — `health_insurance` for 500/485, `apf` for anything but
500/600 — are recorded as prose in the pack and must be chosen by the caller. A UI
must not present them as automatic.

Fixing it means accepting JsonLogic on a transition and routing it through
`RuleEvaluatorService`, which is what every other conditional in a pack already
uses. Until then the workflow is a correct skeleton with manual branching.

### 4.3 Decisions needed from the business

| # | Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Realtime host for chat/presence/collaboration | **Ably** — no infra to run, works alongside serverless; five rows are not worth a second deployment target |
| 2 | Scheduler | **Upstash QStash** or cron-job.org — per-minute, retries, signed requests |
| 3 | Marketing module | **Do not build one.** Newsletters are `messaging.sequences[]`; SEO and social are not regulatory plumbing |
| 4 | AWS migration (BRD §18) | **Stay on Vercel + Neon**; revisit when a contract requires residency Neon cannot give |
| 5 | OCR | **Cloud Vision** — Tesseract on serverless is a bad fit for large scans |

---

## 5. Credentials — nothing works without these

**Free, already yours, just unset.** This is the cheapest work available
anywhere on the list. Golden rule (operator decision, 2026-09-05): **Vercel ·
Neon Postgres · Neon Auth (post-pilot) · DeepSeek · Upstash Redis.**

> **Correction (Jonas, 2026-09-08): `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM` are now set on
> Production**, confirmed by running `vercel env ls production --scope
> qognitionagencys-projects` myself this session — both show `1d ago`. **This was "the
> largest single blocker" as of 2026-09-05; it no longer is.** Invites can now be sent, so
> `POST /iam/users/invite` no longer dead-ends at a log-only link. The row below is corrected
> and moved out of the blocking set. **Nothing in this section's remaining rows has changed** —
> `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are still
> genuinely unset, re-confirmed in the same `vercel env ls` run.

**Vercel Production, full 25-var list, `vercel env ls production` re-run 2026-09-08:**
`RESEND_FROM, RESEND_API_KEY, CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY, IMMISTACK_DB_APP_URL,
IMMISTACK_DB_URL, GOVX_DB_APP_URL, GOVX_DB_URL, CRON_SECRET, CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
DATABASE_APP_URL, RATE_LIMIT_MAX_BANKING, RATE_LIMIT_MAX_IMMIGRATION,
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_GLOBAL, RATE_LIMIT_TTL_MS, BASE_DOMAIN, MAX_FILE_SIZE,
DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY, AWS_REGION, SKIP_CONFIG_PACK_LOADER, VERTICAL,
NODE_ENV, JWT_EXPIRATION, JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_NAME, DATABASE_URL`. Every one
of these is read somewhere in `src`; none is set-but-unread. (23 on 2026-09-05
+ the 2 Resend vars added since = 25.)

**Set, no longer a blocker:** `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM` (the code reads `RESEND_FROM`;
`MAIL_FROM` does nothing and is read by nothing). `POST /iam/users/invite` can now deliver.
Whether delivery is actually succeeding end-to-end (a real inbox receiving the mail, not just
the API accepting the send) is `[UNVERIFIED: end-to-end invite delivery]` — not checked this
session, no test inbox available here.

| Variable | For | Consequence today |
|---|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, three price IDs | BILL | `/billing/checkout` → clean 503. **Test mode first** |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` (golden rule; ADR 0003) or `AI_BASE_URL`/`AI_API_KEY`/`AI_DEFAULT_MODEL`, else `OPENAI_API_KEY` | AI, OCR, radar | every AI feature disabled. **None of `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_DEFAULT_MODEL` is read anywhere in `src` today** — re-grepped each name individually 2026-09-08 (word-boundary, to avoid `AI_API_KEY` false-matching as a substring of `OPENAI_API_KEY`): zero hits, full stop, not even in a comment. Setting any of them has **zero effect**. The platform fallback reads only `OPENAI_API_KEY` (`ai.service.ts:131`), which is also unset. ADR 0003 is the target, not shipped wiring |
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (never the anon key), `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` (optional, defaults `meru-documents`, bucket must be **private**) | DOC | `POST /documents/upload` → clean **503** naming the missing vars. **Operator has chosen Supabase over S3** (fewer required vars: 2 vs S3's 3, defaulted bucket name); `StorageDriverRegistry` also has a real S3 driver, registered only when its own 3 vars are present. Today **neither is configured** — only `AWS_REGION` is set. The service-role key bypasses Supabase RLS — CLAUDE.md §5.1b |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (golden rule; ADR 0004) + a QStash token | rate limiting, refresh-token revocation, idempotency, the minute scheduler | none set, none exist in the Vercel var list at all today, and **`UPSTASH_*` is read by nothing in `src`** (re-grepped 2026-09-08: `grep -rn "UPSTASH" src` — zero hits, anywhere) — setting these today has zero effect until ADR 0004 ships. The queue/rate-limit code reads `REDIS_HOST` (`src/config/configuration.ts:137-138`), not an Upstash var. An interim in-memory rate limiter runs in `api/index.js` (2026-09-05) as a stopgap — fail-open, cannot share state across concurrent function instances, not a substitute for this |
| `CRON_SECRET` — **already set** (verified `vercel env ls`, re-confirmed 2026-09-08) + an external minute-scheduler URL | queue, ingestion, **sanctions screening** | The two Vercel crons are authorised and both run **daily**. Minute-level jobs (queue drain, dispatch, SLA watchdog, alert rules) still fire once a day until QStash / cron-job.org pings `/api/v1/jobs/tick?scope=fast`. Whether the ingest has *succeeded* is a separate question — check `GET /engines/screening/watchlist-status`; until `entries > 0`, `screening.engine.ts:203-216` throws `ScreeningListsUnavailableException`, HTTP **503** `listsLoaded:false` — it fails closed, it does not report a false "clean" |

### 5.1 Loading the sanctions lists — the exact commands

Screening has no URL to configure. `WatchlistIngestService` fetches the public
OFAC SDN CSV, UN Consolidated XML, EU CFSP XML and UK OFSI CSV from hardcoded
official URLs; the only things it needs are `CRON_SECRET` (so the job route
will answer) and one run. `SCREENING_LISTS_URL`, which an earlier capability
report demanded, is read by nothing — do not set it.

```bash
# 1. CRON_SECRET is already set on Production (2026-08-22). Read it with
#    `vercel env pull` is NOT enough (encrypted values pull blank) — use the
#    value from the Vercel dashboard, or rotate it with `vercel env add`.

# 2. Run the ingest once by hand. 30–90 s; returns per-list counts.
curl -X POST https://meru-core.vercel.app/api/v1/jobs/watchlist-ingest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"

# 3. Confirm. `entries` must be > 0 and `lists` should name ofac, un, eu, uk_hmt.
curl https://meru-core.vercel.app/api/v1/engines/screening/watchlist-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <any JWT>"

# 4. Keep it fresh: point a scheduler (cron-job.org, 1-min granularity) at
#    /api/v1/jobs/tick?scope=fast every minute and ?scope=daily once a day,
#    both with the same bearer. Until then the lists go stale after 14 days.
```

Until step 2 has run, `GET /health/capabilities` reports `screening_lists:
unconfigured` naming this section, and `POST /engines/screening` refuses with
503 `{ listsLoaded: false, unavailableReason }`. It never returns `clear` off
an empty table — the built-in sample list that used to stand in is gone.

## 6. Regulator connectors — all eight are SANDBOX

| Adapter | Regulator | To go live |
|---|---|---|
| `au-home-affairs` | AU Department of Home Affairs | registered migration agent or approved integrator; VEVO is the gated part |
| `ae-cbuae` | UAE Central Bank | Open Finance certification |
| `sa-sama` | Saudi SAMA | licensing |
| `qa-qcb` | Qatar Central Bank | licensing |
| `bh-cbb` | Bahrain Central Bank | licensing |
| `ca-ircc` | Canada IRCC | licensing |
| `uk-home-office` | UK Home Office | right-to-work share-code access |
| `nz-inz` | NZ Immigration | VisaView access |

Each keeps its sandbox badge until real credentials are installed, and
`provenance.sandbox` is how the UI knows. **A UI that implies live regulator
data is the worst failure mode this product has.**

Going live for one regulator is `<ADAPTER>_SANDBOX=false` **plus** its
credentials. Either alone leaves the adapter in sandbox, deliberately: the
original rule was `NODE_ENV !== 'production' || <FLAG>`, which meant production
with no credentials declared itself **live**, aimed real requests at the
regulator, and — far worse — reported `provenance.sandbox: false` on the way
out. A missing credential can only ever mean "not licensed yet"
(`c05cadc`).

## 7. Things that will bite you

- **An optional `actor`/`tenantId` parameter is how this bug shape keeps recurring.** Five
  separate resources (documents, storage, `/crm/entities`, `/payments`,
  `/communications/threads`) shipped a service method that could be called with no actor and
  no tenant filter, relying on RLS or the controller to remember the check. §3.0c is the
  latest and broadest instance, and it still leaves two compensating (not root-fixed) checks
  in forms and billing, plus `workflow.service.ts` `listInstances`/`listWorkflows` and
  `orchestration.controller.ts`'s two intelligence routes with no ownership scoping at all.
  When adding a new by-id method on a tenant-scoped entity, make `tenantId` and `actor`
  required parameters from the start.
- **A change for one vertical can break another, silently.** Meru stacks —
  country modules on verticals, verticals on this core — and each layer only
  knows the one below it (`CLAUDE.md` §5.5b). The failure mode has no compile
  error and no red test: entitlements are **frozen into `tenant.settings.modules`
  at provisioning**, so a migration that rewrites module codes for GRC rewrites
  **live ImmiStack grants** as data, and the first symptom is a customer losing
  a module in production. Core changes driven by one vertical must be additive,
  must leave existing values resolving, and must be verified against a tenant of
  the vertical you were *not* working on. `@RequiresModule` in particular must
  never be retrofitted onto a route ImmiStack already calls.
- **Unit tests do not assemble the module graph.** A service can be perfectly
  tested and the app still fail to boot on a missing module import — this repo
  shipped exactly that twice. Run `npm start` and read the route table.
- **The contract sweep passes on a well-formed 503.** It checks shape and
  posture, not whether an integration returned anything real. Both adapter
  defects found so far were caught by *reading a live response*, not by a green
  suite. After any deploy, call one regulator route and look at what came back.
- **`vercel env pull` blanks encrypted values.** A pulled `.env` is not evidence
  a variable is unset in production; check `vercel env ls`.
- **`verticalAttributes` MERGES on PATCH.** Send only what changed.
- **The four engines are cross-vertical**: `/engines/screening`, `/doc-intel`,
  `/vessel/risk`, `/radar/scan`. Distinct from
  `/integrations/{country}/screening`, which calls a *regulator's* service.
- **Config packs only upgrade on a greater `version`.** Edit a pack without
  bumping it and the loader silently keeps the old one.
- **The demo tenants are `status: "trial"`**, not `"active"`, and the trial
  lapses 2026-08-22. Any UI branching on `status === 'active'` renders the wrong
  state for both, and the lapse will look like a regression.
- **Three sessions push to `meru-core-fe`.** `git pull` before every commit.
- **`~/Documents/GitHub/immistack` is not this product.** It is a separate
  35-page prototype still carrying the duplicate `/platform` console that was
  deliberately deleted. Do not develop there; the live app is
  `meru-core-fe/immistack`.
- **Vercel deploys are CLI-only.** Pushing to GitHub does nothing.
- **`POST /auth/register` was removed 2026-09-04, not repaired.** It 500'd on
  the RLS `WITH CHECK` for every caller — the write ran outside the
  `runAsSystem` bypass that wrapped its two reads, back on an unbound
  connection (`iam.service.ts`, was lines 447-471). Fixing only that scoping
  bug would have shipped a worse one: the route was `@Public()`, keyed on
  nothing but a tenant slug, and `POST /tenants/check-slug` is also public and
  anonymously confirms which slugs exist — so a "fixed" version would let
  anyone self-provision into an existing tenant they can guess the slug of,
  including another firm's or a bank's, with no invite and no role gate. No
  product app has ever called it (all three portals' `(auth)` route groups are
  login/forgot/reset only). The two supported paths — `POST /tenants/signup`
  (new workspace) and `POST /iam/users/invite` (authenticated, into your own
  tenant) — are untouched. `scripts/smoke/cross-tenant.sh`'s intra-tenant
  document-isolation block used `/auth/register` to mint cheap same-tenant test
  users and now SKIPs with a stated reason instead of failing; the scoping
  logic it exercised is still covered by
  `src/documents/document-access.service.spec.ts`. **Correction (Jonas, 2026-09-08):**
  the sentence that stood here said invites need `RESEND_API_KEY` and it is unset — that is
  now wrong. `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM` are set on Production (confirmed via `vercel
  env ls` this session), so `POST /iam/users/invite` can send. There is still no admin
  "set initial password" route by design (§5, `UpdateUserDto` carries no `password` field) —
  that part of the sentence still holds. Do not resurrect `/auth/register` to paper over
  either gap.

---

## 8. Frontend contract notes

Rules the frontends hold to, which the API must keep making possible:

- Zero watchlist entries renders "lists not loaded", never "no hits".
- `riskScore: null` renders grey, never green.
- `live: false` is labelled stale on the record itself, not in a page corner.
- A missing position is listed as unplottable, never drawn at 0,0.
- No mock fallback survives in a page: `?? []`, never `?? someMock`.
- Config-pack data is rendered from the pack, never hardcoded — including
  navigation, which now comes from `GET /config-packs/me/navigation`.

Modules the frontend deliberately does **not** want to call directly: `Storage`
(`/documents` wraps it), `Elasticsearch` (`/search` is the right altitude),
`Queue` (`/jobs/status` covers the need).
