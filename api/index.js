// `{ data, meta, error }`, so dropping it here silently breaks all three apps.

/**
 * Vertical-aware rate limiting — mirrors src/main.ts's limiter exactly
 * (same env vars, same key shape, same MER-RATE-0001 envelope), applied as
 * Express middleware before Nest routing so it covers every route including
 * /auth/login, /auth/refresh, /auth/forgot-password and
 * /auth/reset-password. This entrypoint previously omitted it entirely — the
 * comment that used to sit here said "use the platform WAF or a shared store
 * instead", and until now nothing did either, so production auth routes were
 * completely unthrottled. See Anton's security baseline
 * (scratchpad/reports/anton-security-baseline.md #2).
 *
 * HONEST LIMITATION: this is express-rate-limit's default in-memory
 * MemoryStore, same as main.ts. On Vercel each warm lambda instance keeps its
 * own counters, so this bounds abuse against ONE warm instance, not the
 * deployment as a whole — under N concurrently warm instances the effective
 * ceiling is roughly N times these numbers, not a hard limit. That is a real
 * gap, not a hidden one: it is still strictly better than no limiter, which
 * was the state before this change.
 *
 * The durable fix is a shared store. docs/adr/0004-upstash-redis-qstash.md
 * (D1) proposes `@upstash/redis` with atomic INCR/EXPIRE, keyed
 * rl:auth:{ip} / rl:ai:{tenantId} / rl:global:{ip}::{tenantId}, applied in
 * both main.ts and api/index.js. That ADR is Proposed, not merged — do not
 * add the @upstash/redis dependency here until it lands.
 * TODO(ADR-0004): swap this in-memory limiter for the Upstash-backed one once
 * docs/adr/0004-upstash-redis-qstash.md D1 is approved and
 * UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL / UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN are provisioned (verify
 * with `vercel env ls`, not `env pull` — workspace CLAUDE.md §12).
 * [UNVERIFIED: whether Express `trust proxy` is correctly set for Vercel's
 * sin1 region — ADR 0004 §4 flags the same gap for `req.ip`-keyed limits.]
 *
 * Factored out (rather than inlined in `bootstrap()`) so a spec can mount it
 * on a bare Express app and assert the 429/allow behaviour without booting
 * Nest — `bootstrap()` needs a live Postgres connection and can't run in a
 * unit/e2e test here.
