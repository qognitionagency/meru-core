## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 The Problem

Every regulated industry — immigration law, banking compliance, healthcare credentialing, tax filing — builds the same software from scratch. A 50-person immigration law firm and a 5,000-person bank both need: identity management, document storage, workflow automation, communications tracking, audit logging, and AI assistance. Yet there is **no horizontal platform** that provides these as a shared engine.

The result: $500K–$2M and 12–18 months to launch a vertical SaaS product. Every new country adds 6 months. Every new regulation triggers a fire drill.

### 1.2 The Solution

**Meru is a Regulatory Operating System (RegOS).** It provides 80% of the compliance infrastructure as a shared horizontal engine. The remaining 20% — the vertical-specific logic — is injected as JSON configuration packs per industry and country.

| Metric | Without Meru | With Meru |
|---|---|---|
| Time to launch new vertical | 12–18 months | ≤ 6 weeks |
| Time to add new country | 3–6 months | ≤ 3 weeks |
| % of code shared across verticals | 0% | ≥ 80% |
| Per-vertical engineering team needed | 4–6 engineers | 1–2 engineers |

### 1.3 The Three Pillars

1. **Meru Core** — The horizontal engine: 14 shared modules + 4 specialist AI engines
2. **ImmiStack** — Immigration vertical: 4 portals (Admin, Staff, Client, Platform)
3. **GovernanceX** — Banking GRC vertical: Sanctions screening, AML, Trade Finance compliance

Future verticals: Health, Tax/VAT, Labour, Education — each launched via JSON pack in weeks, not years.

### 1.4 Competitive Moat

- **Regulatory network effect**: Each new regulator wired into Meru benefits every vertical. Once the UAE's MOHRE is integrated for Labour, it's available for Immigration and Banking too.
- **JSON config velocity**: Competitors must write code for each vertical/country combination. Meru authors JSON.
- **Compliance trust**: Every action is hash-chain audited, every AI answer is citation-enforced, every tenant is RLS-isolated. Regulators trust the platform.
- **Common Corridor mastery**: UAE, KSA, UK, Canada, Australia — the world's most active regulatory corridors — are the beachhead.
