/**
 * The client list must fail CLOSED.
 *
 * `CrmController.clientScoped` always SETS `subjectEmail` for a `client`-role
 * caller, to `user.email`. `buildEntityListQuery` then tested it for
 * truthiness:
 *
 *     if (filters.subjectEmail) qb.andWhere(...)
 *
 * so an empty or absent JWT email made the predicate disappear entirely and
 * the client received **every record in the tenant** — not zero. The leak the
 * `subjectEmail` column was added to close, reintroduced from the opposite
 * direction by the commit that closed it, and caught in review rather than by
 * a test.
 *
 * The distinction this suite pins is narrow and easy to lose again: "the key
 * is absent" (an unscoped staff query) and "the key is present but unusable"
 * (a client whose identity we could not resolve) must produce opposite
 * outcomes. Truthiness cannot tell them apart. Nothing else in the CRM tests
 * looks at the generated SQL, so without this the next refactor of that `if`
 * has no safety net at all.
