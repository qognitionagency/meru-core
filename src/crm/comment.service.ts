 * author, and a record it hangs off.
 *
 * Built on the existing polymorphic `note` entity type rather than a new table,
 * because a comment *is* a CRM record: it inherits tenant isolation, the audit
 * trail, soft delete and search indexing for free. A dedicated `comments` table
 * would have had to re-earn all four.
 *
 * `internal` is the field that matters for this product. A migration agent's
 * candid note about a client's chances must never reach the client portal, and
 * a flag on the record is the only place that decision can live where every
 * reader sees it.
