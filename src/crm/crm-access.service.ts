/**
 * Who may see which CRM record, decided in one place.
 *
 * **This is the fifth instance of the same bug shape**, and the first one found
 * on a resource that already had the fix half-applied. `CrmController` has had
 * a private `clientScoped()` helper since `/crm/entities` was narrowed — but it
 * was only ever called from the **list** and **export** routes. Every by-id
 * route reached `CrmService.getEntity(id, tenantId)` / `updateEntity(...)`,
 * neither of which takes an actor at all, so a `client` token that knew or
 * guessed a UUID could read *and modify* any other applicant's case: their
 * status, their stage, their assignee, their `verticalAttributes` — which on
 * ImmiStack is where passport and visa data lives.
 *
 * RLS does not help. It isolates tenants, not users inside one.
 *
 * **Ownership has two senses and both are load-bearing.** Staff own by
 * assignment. An applicant owns by being the record's SUBJECT — they are never
 * the assignee of their own case, a staff member is. This class read
 * `assignedTo` alone, and the row below used to say "records assigned to them",
 * which meant a client matched nothing at all: the client portal rendered "no
 * case yet" to every applicant. The same wrong test appeared in four places
 * (here, `CrmController.clientScoped`, `DocumentAccessService` and
 * `WorkflowService`) and all four now compare `subjectEmail` as well.
 *
 * | Caller                 | May read                    | May write / delete   |
 * |------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
 * | inside `runAsGod`      | anything (already audited)  | anything             |
 * | `firm_admin` / `staff` | anything in their tenant    | anything in tenant   |
 * | `client`               | records they are the SUBJECT of, or that are |
 * |                        | assigned to them            | **nothing**          |
 * | bare `platform_admin`  | as above                    | nothing — god path   |
 *
 * ## Why `own` scope is read-only
 *
 * A client legitimately *does* change things — they approve a draft, they
 * accept a cost agreement, they upload a document. None of that is a generic
 * `PATCH /crm/entities/:id`. Those go through purpose-built routes that carry
 * their own meaning and their own audit trail:
 * `POST /crm/entities/:id/acceptance` records assent with a SHA-256 of the
 * exact bytes shown; a stage change is a workflow transition. Letting a client
 * PATCH the record directly would let them rewrite `status`, `assignedTo` or
 * `stage` — reassigning their own matter, or marking it lodged.
 *
 * So: read through this service, write through a named route.
 *
 * ## Ownership is `assignedTo`, and that is not a free choice
 *
 * `DocumentAccessService.ownedEntityIds` already resolves a client's records by
 * `assignedTo`, and says in its own comment that the two must keep reading the
 * same field or "a client sees a case in one place and not the other". This
 * service is bound by that invariant: changing the ownership model here means
 * changing it there in the same commit.
 *
 * **Known limitation, deliberately not guessed at.** A visa matter with a
 * co-applicant or a dependent child has exactly one `assignedTo`, so a second
 * person entitled to see that matter would receive a 404. No relation type in
 * the immigration pack currently designates such a person, so widening this
 * would be inventing a model rather than enforcing one. If co-applicant access
 * is required, add the relation to the pack first, then widen
 * {@link ownsEntity} and `DocumentAccessService.ownedEntityIds` together.
