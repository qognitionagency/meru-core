/**
 * The centrepiece suite for this hardening pass.
 *
 * `CrmService.getEntity/updateEntity/convertEntity/deleteEntity`,
 * `CommentService.add/list`, `AcceptanceService.record/list` and
 * `EntityRelationService.link/unlink/traverse/completionBlockers` all used to
 * reach their repository with no actor at all — RLS confined the query to the
 * tenant and nothing confined it to the caller inside the tenant. This is the
 * fifth documented instance of that shape (`CrmAccessService`'s own comment)
 * and the class of bug this whole branch exists to close.
 *
 * This suite is deliberately shaped as a matrix, not one test per route: the
 * point is to pin the SHAPE of the authorisation decision (scope × action ×
 * ownership) so that a *new* by-id route added later without going through
 * `CrmAccessService` fails here immediately, rather than needing its own
 * bespoke regression test remembered after the fact.
 *
 * Caveat, stated once for the whole file: these are unit tests against the
 * services directly. They prove the seam works when a controller calls it —
 * they cannot prove every controller calls it. A route that forgets
 * `access.assert()` (or forgets to pass `actor` at all — which the compiler
 * now catches for the required-actor methods, but would not for a *new*
 * method authored without that discipline) is a module-wiring fault this
 * suite does not see. That gap needs an e2e or supertest-level check against
 * the real Nest module graph; see `scripts/smoke/cross-tenant.sh`'s
 * intra-tenant section for the equivalent at the HTTP boundary.
