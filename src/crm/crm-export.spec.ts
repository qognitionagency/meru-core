/**
 * `exportEntitiesCsv` used to delegate to `listEntities({ ...filters, page: 1,
 * limit: MAX_ROWS })`, and `listEntities` clamps whatever `limit` it receives to
 * 200 before the query ever runs — so a request for up to 10,000 rows silently
 * became a request for 200, and `total` (used to decide `X-Export-Truncated`) was
 * computed against that same 200-row page rather than the real matching count. A
 * firm exporting 600 matters got a 200-row file with no signal it was a prefix.
 *
 * `exportEntitiesCsv` now builds its own query via the private
 * `buildEntityListQuery` shared with `listEntities` for WHERE/ORDER BY only, and
 * applies its own 10,000-row cap directly. This suite pins that the two routes'
 * caps are independent, not that `listEntities`'s own 200-row clamp is wrong — it
 * is correct for the list route and untouched here.
 *
 * Same construction style as `crm-convert.service.spec.ts`: `CrmService`
 * constructed directly with a hand-rolled repo, everything but `entityRepo`
 * unused for this concern.
