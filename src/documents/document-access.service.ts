/**
 * Who may see which document, decided in one place.
 *
 * **This is the fourth instance of the same bug shape.** `/crm/entities`,
 * `/payments` and `/communications/threads` each reached production
 * tenant-scoped but not user-scoped, because RLS isolates tenants and nothing
 * isolates users inside one. Documents were the worst of the four:
 * `DocumentHubService.canAccessDocument` ended in `return true; // Simplified
 * for now`, so on ImmiStack one visa applicant could read another applicant's
 * passport, and `GET /documents` listed every document in the firm to any
 * authenticated token.
 *
 * The opposite failure was live at the same time and is the reason this service
 * owns both directions: `DocumentsService.checkAccess` allowed *only* the
 * uploader, so a caseworker could not open a document their own client had
 * uploaded. One rule, one place, both answers correct:
 *
 * | Caller                          | May read                                    |
 * |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
 * | inside `runAsGod`               | anything (already audited)                   |
 * | `firm_admin` / `staff`          | anything in their tenant                     |
 * | `client`                        | what they uploaded, plus documents linked to |
 * |                                 | a CRM record they are the SUBJECT of, or     |
 * |                                 | that is assigned to them                     |
 * | bare `platform_admin`           | what they uploaded — operator reach is the   |
 * |                                 | god path, see `isGodContext`                 |
 *
 * Write, delete and share are narrower than read on purpose: a client whose
 * case file is visible to them must not be able to delete the firm's copy of a
 * decision letter. Those actions need the uploader or staff.
