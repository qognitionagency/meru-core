/**
 * The single implementation of "run one named job", extracted from
 * `JobsController` (ADR 0009 §2.3).
 *
 * **Why this exists.** ADR 0007 D7 stated the operator job-run route would
 * "delegate to the same `JobRunService` the existing `/jobs/:job`
 * (machine, `CronSecretGuard`) already calls" — imprecise in a way that
 * mattered: `JobRunService` only *records* outcomes (`.record()`,
 * `.lastRunMap()`); it never owned the per-job dispatch table. That table
 * was a private method on `JobsController` (`handlerFor`, closing over
 * nineteen constructor-injected services) plus the `run()` timing wrapper
 * and `runNamed()` orchestrating them. Reaching that logic from a second,
 * human-operator front door meant either duplicating the `switch` statement
 * (the "two front doors, two implementations that drift the first time a
 * handler changes in one and not the other" failure this ADR exists to
 * avoid) or extracting it once, here.
 *
 * `JobsController.runJobGet`/`runJobPost` are now one-line delegations to
 * `runNamed`. `PlatformJobsController.run` (`platform-jobs.controller.ts`)
 * is the second, human front door this was built for.
 *
 * This is a mechanical, behaviour-preserving move: the same job names, the
 * same 404 on an unrecognised job, the same `run()` timing/logging wrapper,
 * the same `JobRunService.record()` call on both success and failure. Only
 * `AuditService`, `MigrateService` and `ConfigPackLoaderService` — three of
 * the eighteen other constructor params `JobsController` held — are NOT
 * carried over: `AuditService` was already unused by any of this dispatch
 * code (dead injection, confirmed by grep before this extraction), and
 * `MigrateService`/`ConfigPackLoaderService` back the controller's
 * unrelated `POST /jobs/migrate/:target` and `POST /jobs/packs/reload`
 * routes, neither of which goes through `handlerFor` — they stay on
 * `JobsController` directly.
