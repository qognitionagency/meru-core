/**
 * Scheduled-job health for the God UI.
 *
 * A separate controller from `JobsController` because the two have opposite
 * callers: that one is a machine endpoint behind `CRON_SECRET`, this is a
 * human operator holding a JWT. Bolting a JWT route onto a controller with a
 * class-level `CronSecretGuard` would mean the dashboard needed the cron
 * secret to read a status page.
 *
 * **Must be registered before `JobsController`** — that controller declares
 * `@Get(':job')`, and Express matches in registration order, so a later
 * registration would see "status" swallowed as a job name.
