/**
 * WORM (write-once-read-many) enforcement for `audit_logs` — CLAUDE.md §6.5.
 *
 * The log was already tamper-*evident*: every row carries a checksum and a
 * `chainHash` linking it to its predecessor, so an edit can be detected by
 * re-walking the chain. It was not tamper-*resistant*: nothing stopped an
 * UPDATE or DELETE. Detection alone is a weak claim to make to a regulator,
 * because it only holds if somebody re-verifies the chain, and a deletion
 * breaks the chain in exactly the same way a legitimate gap would.
 *
 * Enforced with a trigger rather than an RLS policy on purpose. RLS is
 * bypassed by any role holding BYPASSRLS — which the migration/owner role
 * does — so a policy would protect the log from the application while leaving
 * it open to the connection most likely to be used for an ad-hoc "cleanup".
 * Triggers fire regardless of BYPASSRLS.
 *
 * One exception is carved out: `archived`. The retention job
 * (`RetentionService.sweep`, dispatched from `/jobs/tick?scope=daily`) flips
 * that flag on rows past each tenant's own retention window, and it is
 * metadata about storage, not about what happened. It named
 * `AuditService.archiveOldLogs` until that method was deleted — one unbound,
 * hardcoded-365-day `@Cron` competing with the per-tenant sweep. Every
 * other column is frozen, compared as whole rows so a column added later is
 * protected automatically rather than needing this trigger to be remembered.
 *
 * Remaining exposure, stated plainly: a superuser can `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE
 * TRIGGER` or drop it. Postgres has no construct that survives its own
 * superuser. Genuine WORM needs storage the database cannot reach — periodic
 * export to object storage with an immutability lock (S3 Object Lock in
 * compliance mode). This migration closes the application- and
 * owner-level holes; the export is a separate piece of work.
