/**
 * `orchestration` shipped with zero specs, which is exactly how the bug this
 * file exists for went unnoticed: `GET /orchestration/search/intelligent` and
 * `GET /orchestration/entity/:id/insights` carried `@UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt'),
 * PolicyGuard)` with no `@Roles` — a no-op role check, since `PolicyGuard`
 * only enforces a role list the reflector actually finds — and
 * `extractInsights` reached the entity through the unscoped
 * `CrmService.findEntityById`, which takes no tenant and no actor at all.
 *
 * This suite pins the fix at the service layer: `extractInsights` now goes
 * through `CrmService.getEntity`, which is both tenant- and actor-scoped
 * (`CrmAccessService`, 404-not-403), and `performIntelligentSearch` threads
 * `actor` into `SearchService.search` so `scopeResults` is not a no-op. The
 * controller's `@Roles(STAFF, FIRM_ADMIN)` gate is the first line of defence
 * and is not re-tested here (see the controller's own guard wiring) — this
 * suite is the defence-in-depth layer the task explicitly asked not to skip.
