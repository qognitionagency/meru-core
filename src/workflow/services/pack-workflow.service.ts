/**
 * Turns a pack's `workflows[]` into `workflows` / `workflow_states` /
 * `workflow_transitions` rows for one tenant.
 *
 * Until this existed the pack's workflows were inert end to end: validated,
 * stored, served to the UI as JSON, and never instantiable — there was no
 * `workflows` row for `startWorkflow` to start. This is the largest gap the
 * immigration vertical had (CLAUDE.md §16).
 *
 * Idempotent per tenant and pack workflow id: the origin is recorded on
 * `triggerConfig.pack`, and a second call finds rather than duplicates. A
 * pack version bump does not rewrite a materialised workflow — running
 * instances point at its states — it reports `existing`; re-materialising
 * under a new version is deliberate operator work, not a side effect.
 *
 * Step → state: the first step is START, a step with no outgoing transition
 * is END, everything else INTERMEDIATE. Each step's transitions become
 * CONDITIONAL transitions when they carry a `condition`, MANUAL otherwise.
 * The condition is compiled to JsonLogic by `compileCondition`; one that
 * cannot compile is stored with `unevaluable` set and is never available —
 * a transition nobody can take is a visible, fixable authoring error, while
 * one that opens by default is a silent wrong answer.
